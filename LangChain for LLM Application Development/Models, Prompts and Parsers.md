I have actively demonstrated a growth mindset by taking initiative to deepen my understanding of Generative AI and large language models. I strive to build an inclusive and collaborative environment by sharing resources and learnings with peers who are also new to these concepts. Even though I’ve not been staffed on a project yet, I make sure to stay connected with my team and stay aligned with Accenture’s culture of continuous learning and collaboration.

I have actively demonstrated a growth mindset by taking initiative to deepen my understanding of Generative AI and large language models through self-learning. I strive to build an inclusive and collaborative environment by sharing resources and learnings with peers who are also new to these concepts. Even though I’ve not been staffed on a project yet, I make sure to stay connected with my team and stay aligned with Accenture’s culture of continuous learning and collaboration.


While I haven’t been staffed on a project yet, I want to stay ready by continuing hands-on learning and strengthening both my practical and theoretical understanding. I’ve built experience with tools like FastAPI and PostgreSQL and explored topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I'm also aiming to apply this knowledge through mini-projects that simulate real-world use cases. In the future, I aspire to take on roles in AI/ML-focused projects, where I can contribute both technically and strategically to solving business problems.

While I haven’t been staffed on a project yet, I’m actively preparing by deepening both practical and conceptual knowledge. I’ve built foundational skills with tools like FastAPI and PostgreSQL, and recently started working hands-on with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), implementing basic examples to understand its real-world applications. I’ve also begun exploring the emerging area of agentic AI and plan to grow further through focused mini-projects. My aim is to become project-ready for AI/ML roles where I can contribute meaningfully to solving business challenges.
