**Challenges in Productions:**

**Scaling Performance**
**Unpredictability of Prompts**
**Messy Real World Data**
**Security and Privacy**
**The "Eat Rocks" Case**

**Robust Observability System:**
**Key Metrics:**

**Software Performance Metrics**: latency, throughput, memory and compute usage.
**Quality Metrics:** User satisfaction and system output quality.

**How to Track**

**LLM Observability Platforms:** 
**Phoenix by Arize:**
**Traces**
**DATADOG** and **Grafana**

**Custom Datasets:**

Collection of previously received prompts and information on its journey through system.

**Quantization:**
Compression for both LLMs and vects generated by embedding models.

**LLM Quantization:**
16-bit params
Quantized models: 8 or 4 bit

**Embedding Vectors Quantization:**
768 dims use 32-bit floating point numbers = 3KB for every vector
**Integer Quantization:** 32 --> 8
**Matryoshka Quantization:** Only choose a subset of vector dims when doing things like comparing similarity.
Dims are ordered so that early ones contain most differentiating information.

**Reducing Latency:**
**LLM Latency Techniques:**
**Caching:**

**Direct:** Return cached responses immediately when close matches are found, skipping slow generation step.
**Personalized:** Feed cached response and user prompt to a small, fast LLM to make adjustments for better relevance.  

**Retrieval Latency Techniques:**
**Quantized Embeddings:** embeddings that are binary/low-quantized vectors.
**Database Sharding:** Split large indexes across instances.

**Security:**
**Authenticate**
**Data Tenant Separation:** Each user accesses only their authorized DB.

**Multi-modal Model:** Text + Images, Audio and Video
Typical Multi-modal RAG: Text + Images

**MM Embedding-Model:** Embed multiple formats of data into same vector space.
**Language Vision Model:** Processes both text and images using a shared token sequences.
**Image Tokenization:** Breaks images into patch-based tokens, 100-1000 tokens.
**MM Transformer:** Understands text-image relationships through a unified transformer.
