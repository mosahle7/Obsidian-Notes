**Challenges in Productions:**

**Scaling Performance**
**Unpredictability of Prompts**
**Messy Real World Data**
**Security and Privacy**
**The "Eat Rocks" Case**

**Robust Observability System:**
**Key Metrics:**

**Software Performance Metrics**: latency, throughput, memory and compute usage.
**Quality Metrics:** User satisfaction and system output quality.

**How to Track**

**LLM Observability Platforms:** 
**Phoenix by Arize:**
**Traces**
**DATADOG** and **Grafana**

**Custom Datasets:**

Collection of previously received prompts and information on its journey through system.

**Quantization:**
Compression for both LLMs and vects generated by embedding models.

**LLM Quantization:**
16-bit params
Quantized models: 8 or 4 bit

**Embedding Vectors Quantization:**
768 dims use 32-bit floating point numbers = 3KB for every vector
**Integer Quantization:** 32 --> 8
**Matryoshka Quantization:** Only choose a subset of vector dims when doing things like comparing similarity.
Dims are ordered so that early ones contain most differentiating information.
